Searching and Generating Images by Using Sentences

In this projects,I am trying to training two model which are pseudo siamese network and GAN.

Targets :
1. Searching twenty relatively images which are described by five specific sentences.
2. Generating one similarly image by using the previous five specific sentences.

Inputs :
1. Five sentences in english which describe :
  1.1 What's kinds of fabrics
  1.2 What's the color series 
  1.3 Visualization patterns of fabric
  1.4 More details of pattern descriptions 
  1.5 Handfeel of fabric

Model_Used : 
1. (pseudo siamese network) 
  1.1 pretrained_Bert
  1.2 CNN model
2. GAN-GP
